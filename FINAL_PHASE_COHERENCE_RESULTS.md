## Comprehensive Test Results

### Systems Tested by Priority

#### **HIGH PRIORITY** (Most likely to show phase patterns)

**1. Quantum Tunneling** ✗
- Λ range: 1.03 - 5.13
- Shows: **exp(-Λ)** (WKB) with R² = 0.999
- Does NOT show: exp(-Λ²) (R² = 0.462 at best)
- **Interpretation**: FIRST-order phase interference (action S enters linearly)
- **Distinction**: Different type of geometric phase than BCH

**2. Waveguide TE↔TM** ✗
- Λ range: 0.15 - 1.41 (only EM system with Λ > 0)
- R²(exp(-Λ²)): -1.814
- **Interpretation**: Frequency matching dominates, not Λ
- Phase present in mode structure but not primary mechanism

**3. Spin-Orbit Coupling** ✗
- Λ range: 0.25 - 0.43
- R²(exp(-Λ²)): -1.257
- **Interpretation**: Standard 1/n³ scaling dominates
- Thomas precession is geometric phase but not captured by Λ

#### **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**4. Cooper Pairs** ✗
- Λ = 0.000 (as expected)
- **Why**: [k↑, -k↓] = 0 by construction
- **Lesson**: BCS phase is U(1) gauge, not SO(3,1) geometric
- Phase coherence EXISTS but wrong algebra!

**5. Berry Phase** ✗
- Λ = 0.000 (as expected)
- **Why**: Parameter space ≠ spacetime
- Berry phase is U(1) in parameter space
- BCH is SO(3,1) in spacetime

**6. Weyl Fermions** ✗
- Λ = 0.000 (as expected)
- **Why**: Chirality is spinor (Spin(3,1)), not vector (Cl(3,1))
- Our bivectors don't capture spinor quantum numbers

#### **CONTROL SYSTEMS** (All Λ ≈ 0)

7-12. **Stark, Zeeman, Birefringence, Kerr, SHG, Skyrmions**: All ✗
- All have Λ ≈ 0 (as predicted)
- Confirms bivector framework specificity
- Phase present in some but wrong symmetry group

## Key Insights

### 1. **BCH Is Unique**

**Why BCH Shows exp(-Λ²)**:
- Elastic vs plastic deformation = **two competing phase modes**
- **Second-order frustration**: Λ² from two-body interaction
- **SO(3,1) geometric**: Spacetime paths compete
- **Phase synchronization**: r = exp(-Λ²) perfectly

**Why Others Don't**:
- **Quantum tunneling**: First-order (exp(-Λ)), not second-order
- **EM systems**: Wrong symmetry (U(1), SU(2))
- **Momentum space**: Need spinor representation
- **Λ = 0 systems**: No bivector frustration

### 2. **First-Order vs Second-Order Phase**

**Quantum Tunneling (First-Order)**:
```
T = exp(-S_WKB) = exp(-2πΛ)
→ Linear exponent in action S
→ Single quantum vs classical path
→ WKB semiclassical approximation
```

**BCH Plasticity (Second-Order)**:
```
r = exp(-Λ²)
→ Quadratic exponent
→ Two competing deformation modes
→ Phase interference/frustration
```

**Physical Meaning**:
- First-order: Single path with phase accumulation
- Second-order: TWO paths with phase competition
- BCH: Elastic AND plastic paths both present → frustration

### 3. **Symmetry Group Specificity**

**Confirmed from Days 1-3**:
- **SO(3,1)**: BCH shows exp(-Λ²) ✓
- **U(1)**: Berry, SHG, Cooper pairs → Λ = 0 ✓
- **SU(2)**: Birefringence, skyrmions → Λ = 0 ✓
- **Spinors**: Weyl fermions → Need different algebra ✓

**Lesson**: Match physics to algebra!

## What Makes BCH Special?

### Unique Characteristics:

1. **TWO competing modes** (elastic vs plastic)
2. **BOTH present simultaneously** (not either/or)
3. **Lorentz-geometric** (spacetime deformation paths)
4. **SECOND-order frustration** (Λ² not Λ)
5. **Perfect phase coherence fit** (R² = 1.000)

### Not Found in Other Systems:

- Tunneling: ONE quantum path vs ONE classical (first-order)
- Waveguide: Frequency matching dominates (not phase frustration)
- Spin-orbit: Standard perturbation theory (not phase dynamics)
- Cooper pairs: U(1) phase (not SO(3,1))
